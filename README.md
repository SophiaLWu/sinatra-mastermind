# sinatra-mastermind

This is a Mastermind web app that allows users to play the classic mastermind game against a computer.

Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players in which one player is the codemaker and one player is the codebreaker. The codemaker chooses a code of four color pegs. Each turn, the codebreaker must try to guess the secret code. On each turn for each peg, the player will be told if the peg is in the correct color and position or if there exists a peg in that color but it is in the wrong position. The codebreaker has 12 turns to break the code. 

The original Mastermind script can be found [here](https://github.com/SophiaLWu/project-OOP-with-ruby/tree/master/mastermind).
